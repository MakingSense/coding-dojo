# Sorting algorithms

A sorting algorithm is an algorithm made up of a series of instructions that takes an array as input, performs specified operations on the array, sometimes called a list, and outputs a sorted array. Sorting algorithms are often taught early in computer science classes as they provide a straightforward way to introduce other key computer science topics like Big-O notation, divide-and-conquer methods, and data structures such as binary trees, and heaps. There are many factors to consider when choosing a sorting algorithm to use.

Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to implement the following:

- A sorting algorithm that is **not stable** (find out what this means) and with **O(n*log(n))** worst-case time complexity
- A sorting algorithm that **is stable** and with **O(n^2)** worst-case time complexity

Good luck!
